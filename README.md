**Mocks aren't stubs.** In this article Martin Fowler talks about *behaviour verification*, a different style of testing using mock objects vs *state verifaction* using stubs objects. This article also clarifies what types of *test doubles* can be used in order to improve our tests. https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html
