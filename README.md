# How do I (start to) see TDD

> The secret in testing is in writing testable-code

What does this mean? **Testing bad code (badly designed code) is difficult**.

> The TDD cycle is very detail-oriented and requires you to **make some design decisions when writing tests, rather than when writing production code**. Obviously those who do TDD know that TDD drastically helps to **enforce good design**.

**TDD is just as much about design as it is about test**. It's all about developing/designing in a **"slower" (slow id good)** way to be able to think about how I want the different collaborators to relate and collaborate. **Maybe we can improve our software quality applying TDD**. Quality is not negotiable. And yes, it takes time & money. So does fixing defects in production software.

> **Test code is just as importante as production code. It is not a second-class citizen. It requieres thought, design and care. It must be kept as clean as production code.**

Tests deserve the same respect as our production code. Apply merciless **refactoring**, just as one should do for production code.

> Los frameworks te hacen ir rápido cuando deberías de ir despacio (Luis Artola en boca de Xabi Saez de Ocariz).

Esto podemos tratar de evitarlo aplicando TDD.
